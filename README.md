# Crazed Shaman Bot

Crazed Shaman is a helper bot for the Discord Werewolf server. 
You can join our community using this link: https://discord.gg/GD6R3rQ

The Crazed Shaman Bot powers an activity level system as well as a player rankings system.

Activity points are points awarded to users based on their level of activity and presence in the Discord Werewolf 
community, by awarding a certain amount of points per message on the server. Short posts won't be awarded points, and 
spamming will trigger a spam filter that automatically deducts points from your overall score. Playing in Werewolf 
games will help you gain points faster! In addition, your score decays over time, so stay active in the community to 
keep up!
